# To-do list TOP

Fully functioning to-do list with local storage (clear local storage by opening dev tools and entering `localStorage.clear()` into the console).

Lots of challenges face with this:
- Understanding modules and code organisation, as well as scope
- Understanding classes/constructors and getters
- Practice with dynamically generating DOM content (restaurant page project was amazing for practising this)
- Using data attributes in HTML
- Trying to shift thinking with CSS from styling "sections" and "elements" to applying utility-based classes if appropriate (to reduce repetition)
- Learning how the Date object works and manipulation of it
- Learning how local storage works and some issues surrounding classes/methods and JSON - required parsing the stored strings then reconstructing them as class objects
- More practice with more advanced CSS selectors
- Learning about the dialog tag and built-in modal methods
- More practice with basic CSS animations
